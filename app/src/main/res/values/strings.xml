        <item>In an alternate reality, a human named Ymir Fritz became a humanoid giant called a Titan (巨人 Kyojin) 1,800 years ago after making a contract with the \"Devil of All Earth\". Though she died 13 years later as side-effect of her new power, it was divided and passed on through her daughters before being divided into nine individuals who established the Eldian Empire. The Founding Titan remained with the Fritz family as they conquered the Marley nation and ruled over it for 1,700 years. But a century before the events of the main storyline, the Eldian king Karl Fritz was disillusioned by his family legacy and orchestrated his nation\'s downfall with Marley making the Eldians that remained into second class citizens while threatening to exile them to Paradis as mindless Pure Titans. Karl took the remainder to the island of Paradis and used countless Colossal Titan bodies to construct a walled city with three enormous curtain walls: the outermost being Wall Maria (ウォール・マリア Wōru Maria); the middle wall is Wall Rose (ウォール・ローゼ Wōru Rōze, sometimes pronounced like rosé) and the innermost is Wall Sheena (ウォール・シーナ Wōru Shīna, alt. \"Wall Sina\"). Karl then used the Founding Titan\'s power to erase the memories of most of the Eldians with those unaffected either bribed into nobility or made into outcasts like the Ackerman family who served the Fritz family. Due to the Founding Titan\'s power, Karl influenced his direct descendants into continuing his work of ruling the Eldians within the walls through promoting fear of attack by Titans, who are Eldians that the Marleyians transformed and exiled on Paradis to terrorize the island\'s residents.</item>
        <item>The Walking Dead takes place after the onset of a worldwide zombie apocalypse. The zombies, colloquially referred to as \"walkers\", shamble towards living humans and other creatures to eat them; they are attracted to noise, such as gunshots, and to different scents, e.g. humans. Although it initially seems that only humans that are bitten or scratched by walkers can turn into other walkers, it is revealed early in the series that all living humans carry the pathogen responsible for the mutation. The mutation is activated after the death of the pathogen\'s host, and the only way to permanently kill a walker is to damage its brain or destroy the body, such as by cremating it. The series centers on sheriff\'s deputy Rick Grimes, who wakes up from a coma. While in a coma, the world has been taken over by \"zombies.\" He becomes the leader of a group of survivors from the Atlanta, Georgia, region as they attempt to sustain and protect themselves not only against attacks by walkers but by other groups of survivors willing to use any means necessary to stay alive.</item>

        <item>It is set in 2010 in Akihabara, Tokyo, and follows Rintaro Okabe, a self-proclaimed \"mad scientist\", who runs the \"Future Gadget Laboratory\" in an apartment together with his friends Mayuri Shiina and Itaru \"Daru\" Hashida. While attending a conference about time travel, Okabe finds the dead body of Kurisu Makise, a neuroscience researcher; he sends a text message about it to Daru, and later discovers that Kurisu is alive, and that the message arrived before he sent it. The laboratory members learn that the cell phone-operated microwave oven they are developing can send text messages back in time; they are joined by Kurisu, and investigate it, sending text messages – referred to as \"D-mails\" – to the past to change the present. Kurisu eventually creates a device that can send memories through the microwave oven, effectively allowing the user to time travel. SERN, a fictional organization based on CERN secretly researching time travel, learns of the time machine and sends people to the laboratory to retrieve it, killing Mayuri in the process. Okabe goes back in time multiple times to prevent Mayuri\'s death, but fails each time. He learns that he needs to undo all the changes their D-mails have caused, and does so until he realizes that undoing the first D-mail would return him to the timeline where Kurisu was found dead. Okabe and Kurisu tell each other about their romantic feelings for one another, after which Kurisu tells Okabe to save Mayuri. Daru hacks into SERN\'s database, and they delete the record of the D-mail, returning them to the original timeline.</item>
